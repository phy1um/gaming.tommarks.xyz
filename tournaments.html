    <h1>Tournament Results</h1>
    <p>I have never done well in tournaments, but I want a record of notable events I have competed in. I competed in many online events in 2014 which I have lost records of, and from mid-late 2014 my main focus became commentating events. I hope to play more tournaments in the future and commit to achieving better results.
