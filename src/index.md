# Tom Marks Talks Games 

## What

I'm a sweaty FPS player and commentator from Australia. I've commentated lots of Aussie
Quake tournaments, plus other AFPS games such as QuakeWorld, CPMA, Reflex and Diabotical. 
I make Youtube videos talking about the genre with a focus on meta and pro match breakdowns.

As of mid 2021 I'm taking a hiatus, but I plan to come back in 2022 for Kuachicups AQL Season 3.

By day I work as a programmer, and I have a [website for that here.](https://coding.tommarks.xyz)

## Why Quake

I made a video about my relationship with Quake, and how it has changed my life.
