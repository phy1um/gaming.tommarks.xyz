# Tom Marks Talks Games - SITE WIP

## What

I'm a programmer and gamer from Australia making videos, running
livestreams and commentating gaming tournaments. My content focusses on
competitive and high-skill games, especially arcade/arena FPS titles (eg
Quake).

## How to Support Me

Donations power my content. I prefer direct support through donations or
recurring Patreon payments (TBA) over Twitch bits/subscriptions.
